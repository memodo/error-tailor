# Memodo Snapshot

Branch *memodo-snapshot* is used to copy the state of Error Tailor at points when we update/align it with our MeWi project. The idea is to use the diff between *memodo-snapshot* and *master* to clearly see changes since the last alignment. This allows decoupling from forced syncs with the upstream repo.
